# Open Wavefront Reconstructor: 1.0.0


![Alt text](pics/OWR_a.png?raw=true "Title")

**OWR** (Open Wavefront Reconstructor) is a library written in C++ with a high degree of configuration, and it is aimed to facilitate future research in the field of wafefront reconstruction, as well as to provide a ready-to-go framework for being used in control systems.

The library contains the following capabilities:


* A mock-up generator of various types of incident wavefronts
* Implementation of different wavefront reconstruction algorithms: Zernike polynomials and Half Circular Harmonics for circular domains, and Legendre polynomials for square domains
* Runtime selection of the linear algebra library to perform the algebraic computations 
* Time profiling of the linear algebraic operations

All software entities are fully decoupled, therefore **OWR** can be easily modified or extended. 

<!--Additionally, porting the linear algebra functions to specific hardware architectures is part of our future work, which is aimed to decrease the CPU times below the millisecond for the operations associated with Equations (10) and (11). According to our experience, this will make the OpenWavefrontReconstructor an interesting option in control systems where the reconstruction is required to be nearly real-time, such as in the adaptive optics [4,14]. The diagram depicted in Figure 3 provides the different options offered by the library, and it shows a typical work flow that can be described as follows: 1.-->

<!--The user can choose the input wavefront as a simulated optical field generated by the mock-up generator, or as a direct input from a sensor. Usually, the sensor vendors provide libraries that can be used to retrieve information such as the focal spots coordinates, where the slopes are measured, and obviously these also provide the slopes. These coordinates and slopes are the inputs received by OpenWavefrontReconstructor, and are used to configure the matrices M and R defined by Equations (8) and (11). Similarly, the user can choose the particular algorithm that will perform the wavefront reconstruction, which can be instantiated as an object from the available classes representing the different approaches (see the previous enumeration list—item 2—for the list of available polynomials). Finally, the user can also select, at runtime, the linear algebra library to perform the linear algebraic operations. In version 1.0.0 of OpenWavefrontReconstructor, only the armadillo library is merged in the code; however, we plan to include more options, and the user can also implement the libraries of his/her preference. OpenWavefrontReconstructor’s design is intended to provide an easy-to-follow (nearly copy-paste) environment to implement new linear algebra libraries. -->

## Architecture
### Work Flow
The diagram depicted below provides an overview of the different options offered by the library, and it shows a typical work flow that can be described as follows:
1. The user can choose the input wavefront as a simulated optical field generated by the mock-up generator, or as a direct input from a sensor. Usually, the sensor vendors provide libraries that can be used to retrieve information such as the focal spots coordinates, where the slopes are measured, and obviously these also provide the slopes. These coordinates and slopes are the inputs received by OpenWavefrontReconstructor, and are used to configure the matrices M and R defined by Equations (8) and (11). 
2. Similarly, the user can choose the particular algorithm that will perform the wavefront reconstruction, which can be instantiated as an object from the available classes representing the different approaches (see the previous enumeration list—item 2—for the list of available polynomials). 
3. Finally, the user can also select, at runtime, the linear algebra library to perform the linear algebraic operations. 

_Note: in version 1.0.0 of **OWR**, only the armadillo library is merged in the code; however, we plan to include more options, and the user can also implement the libraries of his/her preference. 
**OWR**'s design is intended to provide an easy-to-follow (nearly copy-paste) environment to implement new linear algebra libraries._

### Uml
Sequence and class diagrams are (will be) included in `doc` folder: 
```
sequenceDiagram.odg
UML.xmi
```

##  Installation 
###  Dependencies
- The algebraic operations are implemented by means of the linear algebra library [armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net/).
- The logging is performed by  [log4CXX](https://logging.apache.org/log4cxx/latest_stable/).
- To 3D plot the final graphics the command-line driven graphing utility [Gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/).
 
###  Build process and quick run

To generate the executable in `SRC/bin`:

```
cd SRC
make all
```

And to execute it: 

```
cd SRC/bin
./OWR
```

Note that in the same folder `bin` are located: 
- the configuration file for the logging facility: `Log4cxxConfig.xml`
- the parser file with the available runtime options: `config.cfg`


##  Usage

###  MockUp generator 
The library includes a wavefront generator (the class MockWaveFrontGenerator provides both the surface as well as the gradients of the surface; the surface and gradients are evaluated aa a set of points, which are also generated by the MockWaveFrontGenerator object). The shapes of the wavefronts are listed above (as options for the mock_wave_front keyword). 

Custom gradients can also be parsed. Should you like support on this, please read the [ Contributing](#-contributing) section on how to get support.

##  FAQ

##  Known bugs/limitations
The point (x,y)=(0,0) must not be present in the grid, because this point causes some problems in the reconstruction. To the best of our knowledge this problem is also present in the Zernike reconstruction. A good strategy is to remove it from the grid, and the best is to set of the center of the grid such that the first neighbor nodes are +-l/2 (in both x and y directions), where l is the distance between two consecutive nodes either in x or y direction.
